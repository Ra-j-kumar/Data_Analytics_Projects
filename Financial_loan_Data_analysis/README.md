# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to derive meaningful business insights using key performance indicators (KPIs) and visual analytics.  
The goal is to help stakeholders understand lending performance, borrower behavior, and overall portfolio health.

The analysis is driven by a **Business Requirements Document (BRD)** and is designed to support data-driven decision-making for banking and financial institutions.
